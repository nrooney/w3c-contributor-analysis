# W3C Contributor Analysis
This repo is a collaborative analysis on the people contributing to the W3C. It aims to provide some insight into the appropriateness of the W3C model in being conducive to developing standards for the web. 

**Note1: if you are a person who wants to / is particpating in W3C but the participation model is impacting you, please add your name to the ["I am Experiecing Barriers in Participating at W3C"](/nrooney/w3c-contributor-analysis/blob/master/README.md#i-am-experiecing-barriers-in-participating-at-w3c) section**

**Note2: this repo is not making any assumption on the W3C model. It aims to discover whether their is an issue, and the extent an issue by undertaking a study of the current situation.**

## Problem Description
The W3C "is an international community where Member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards" [[ref](https://www.w3.org/)]. To partake in standards creation an individual is required to be part of a member organisation; in most cases this comes with a membership fee. Not only this but participating in W3C Working or Interest Groups usually comes at a required level of travel; meaning individuals who wish to participate in W3C either have to secure funding for their travel requirements or self-fund.

The W3C has proposed and put into place a number of methods to help solve these issues, including creating the [Invited Experts](#) role, creation of [Community Groups](#) and the [WCIG](#). Despite this, many people still find barriers to working on standards within the W3C.

## Data Collection
This repo will be collecting the following data. After an adaquate round of data collection some analysis will be run. Suggestions for analysis running are welcome (thanks to those who suggested [GrimoireLab](https://grimoirelab.gitbooks.io/tutorial/)).

* W3C Spec Editor breakdown by:
  * Member editors
  * Members editors who are Browser Vendor Employees
  * Invited Expert / Non Member Editors
* W3C Working Group / TAG Github Contributions (same breakdown as above)
* Numbers of people interested in working in W3C but unable to for some reason
* Active Community Groups which are halting Working Group status (most likely due to needing to lose members)

@todo add others
