# W3C Contributor Analysis
This repo is a collaborative analysis on the people contributing to the W3C. It aims to discover whether the W3C model is conducive to developing standards for the web.

## Problem Description
The W3C "is an international community where Member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards" [[ref](https://www.w3.org/)]. However, to partake in standards creation an individual is required to be part of a member organisation; in most cases this comes with a membership fee. Not only this but participating in W3C Working or Interest Groups usually comes at a required level of travel; meaning individuals who wish to participate in W3C either have to secure funding for their travel requirements or self-fund.

The W3C has proposed and put into place a number of methods to help solve these issues, including creating the [Invited Experts](#) role, creation of [Community Groups](#) and the [WCIG](#). Despite this, many people still find barriers to working on standards within the W3C.
